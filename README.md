# RPA – Rule-Based Personal Assistant Chatbot

**RPA (Responsive Personal Assistant)** is an ultra-responsive, rule-based chatbot developed using Python. It simulates intelligent and context-aware conversation without relying on machine learning or external APIs. Designed as a modular, memory-enabled assistant, RPA can handle various user queries and respond in real-time with precision and personality.

This is my first full-scale project aimed at combining real-world usefulness with simplicity and speed — part of my long-term vision to create human-compatible AI systems.
